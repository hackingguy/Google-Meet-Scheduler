[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### Bot for scheduling and entering google meet sessions automatically.

### Installation Guide
1. Open terminal on your PC
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/AmanRaj1608/Google-Meet-Scheduler.git`
3. Go inside the project directory
4. Rename `.env-example` file to `.env` and replace your email and password there
5. Install dependencies `npm install`
6. Start the application `npm start`

Now the project has started on `localhost:3000`

### Usage Guide
Now when you visit the page you will see things to add 
- Meet Link
- Start Time
- End time 

Then submit and do what you wanted to, it will log in and join meet for you. 

You can add more links there to add it to the queue.


### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) should be installed
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) with version 70+
- Works only on windows (see [Issue #2](https://github.com/AmanRaj1608/Google-Meet-Scheduler/issues/8) for more info)


### Todo

You can however deploy it by creating an API that will ask for OTP and while sign-in you give that info to the server.
This can be implemented as a new branch especially for deployment purpose

### How it works
Project is made using [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) which is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium. We open a chromium app on server where we can add create open tabs see browser versions and everything.

So here we are using `puppeteer-extra` and `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` which helps in creating an instance of chrome where google don't able to detect that it is created by puppeteer. So using this plugin we can login into google without filling capcha.
